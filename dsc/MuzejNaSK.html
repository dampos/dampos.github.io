    <p>MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF SKOPJE – was founded in 1948. In 1970 it was housed into an adapted part of the Railway Station where the great clock on the frontal façade of the building has remained forever stopped at 5:17 a.m., marking the moment when the earthquake first struck on July 26th, 1963. Since then, this object is protected as a cultural monument and it functions as a complex museum which includes the fields of archeology, history, ethnology, art history and the contemporary art in the region of city of Skopje.</p>
